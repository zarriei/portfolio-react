# Responsive-Portfolio

# Description

The assignment responsive portfolio was tasked to us for two primary purposes.
First, it allowed us to build the framework for our digital portfolio. while building the foundation of our portfolio,
we were asked to utilize Bootstrap and all it had to offer to make our page layouts/designs concise with aconsistent flow.
Consistent flows were achiveed by utilizing the grid system in Bootstrap.
This assignment was actually quite enjoyable. I not only learned how to utilize Bootstrap to build quick frameworks but have realized how everything that we
have been learning is a building block ultimately for something else.

Second, this assignment tasked us to make sure our websites were responsive in regards to a variety of different screen sizes. This day and age, screens are only getting smaller (and curvier as well) and most people use their phones to quickly acess the world wide web. As a result, it is of the up most importance that our websites, and especially our portfolio, auto-adjusts to fit the respective screen of the device. I am most eager to use more of what I learn to mold my portfolio into a profesional grade digital portfolio in which can and will be used on the hunt for my next role within my company.

The Portfolio was created via react and it took a bit of a learning curve to learn but it was a great learning experience.

Furthermore, have a good foundation in anyting is vital. I believe that this assignment and the use of Bootstrap will come in handy throughout my professional or personal endeavors.

I have updated my portfolio page to incorporate two homework assignments and our most recent project that we have finished.
